## Contributor expectations
If you are looking for contributors, make sure you set the ground rules. There’s nothing worse than getting someone who wants to help you but they don’t know how! This section of the README gives the guidelines for contributions. Do you expect someone to create an issue in the issue queue and then resolve it with a pull request? Do you want squashed commits? Do you have a pull requests template? Explain it all here.
